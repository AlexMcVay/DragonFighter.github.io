# Text-Based Monster Fighting Game

This is a text-based monster fighting game inspired by the role-playing game project from [freeCodeCamp's JavaScript curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game). It includes some modifications and enhancements made by me.
